 # Polygon
 A shape existing of at least three connected vertices and, thus, of at least three sides.

// Create a pentagon:

let circle = Circle(in: Square(origin: .zero, edges: 50.0))
let points = circle.pointsAlongPerimeter(dividedInto: 5)

// Initialize a polygon by passing a sequence of points:

let polygon1 = Polygon(points: points)

// The points are stored in a rearranged fashion for faster calculations:

polygon1.points

// Initialize a polygon by passing a number of line segments:

let square = Square(origin: .zero, edges: 10.0)
let polygon2 = Polygon(lineSegments: square.lineSegments)

polygon1.lineSegments
polygon2?.lineSegments

polygon1.edgeCount
polygon2?.edgeCount

polygon1.isSelfIntersecting
polygon1.isConvex
polygon1.isConcave

// `Polygon` type conforms to `PolygonType` protocol, which inherits from `Shape` protocol:

polygon1.area
polygon1.perimeter
polygon1.center // Is the most common: the centroid.

polygon1.minX
polygon1.minY

polygon1.maxX
polygon1.maxY

polygon1.midX
polygon1.midY

polygon1.width
polygon1.height
polygon1.boundingRect

polygon1.contains(CGPoint(x: 25.0, y: 25.0))

// A handy extension on a collection of CGPoints to calculate the convex hull â€“ a polygon that
// wraps around the collection of points like a rubber band:

var pointCloud = [CGPoint]()
100.do {
    pointCloud.append(CGPoint(x: drand48() * 100.0, y: drand48() * 100.0))
}

if let convexHull = pointCloud.convexHull {
    convexHull
    convexHull.edgeCount
    convexHull.boundingRect
}
