 # Metron

 Hi and thanks for checking out Metron. This geometry library extends the basic CoreGraphics geometric types and introduces several new types that will make your programming life easier.

 ## Set Up

 Re-open this playground inside the `Metron.workspace` if it isn't already and build `Metron` scheme for a simulator 
 device â€“ the latter is critical.

 ðŸ’¡ Xcode can be difficult sometimes with workspace playgrounds. If you find it failing to run try quitting Xcode, delete 
 the derived data, reopen the workspace and rebuild the scheme. If that didn't help, commenting and uncommenting the contents 
 of `Playground/Sources/Playground.swift` might help by triggering the playground rebuild. Good luck!

 ## Types

 Metron introduces several new types, namely:

 * Line
 * LineSegment
 * Circle
 * Triangle
 * Square
 * Polygon
 * Corner
 * Angle

 The following playgrounds show various ways to initialize these types, and explore their properties and usage.
